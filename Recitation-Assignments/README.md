# Final Project

* The final project will be considered as the outcome of the course, which is understanding and effective implementation of deep learning to provide practical solutions to realistic tasks. At least two scenarios for the project can be imagined, applications, and development of deep learning. Developing algorithms and methods is a valuable target, however, it may be challenging. On the other side, applications are recommended for this project. Students should decide on a topic for the project based on their interests as well as discussion with their mentor, who is one of the teaching assistants up to their choice. Mentors could provide advice and assistance during the topic selection and main progress. The following steps and schedule are expected: 

    - Contacting a mentor and deciding on a topic - *Deadline: Mehr 30*
    - Submitting a brief proposal of the project - *Deadline: ~~Aban 30~~ Extended to Azar 7*
    - Proposal approval by the mentor - *Please manage it to be done in Aban!*
    - **The main phase of the project**
    - Submitting a poster or a brief report of the progress - *Deadline: ~~Dey 1~~ Extended to Dey 10*
    - Poster/Progress presentation - *~~Dey 3~~ Dey 11 at 16:00*
    - Submitting the final report as well as codes and data - *Deadline: ~~Bahman 10~~ Extended to Bahman 17*
    - Seminar presentation - *~~Bahman 12~~ Bahman 19*
  
**Please Note**: You can find many sample projects as well as datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Moreover, take a look at final projects at Stanford's [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html). The project will have a notable share in the final score of the course. Creativity, innovations as well as a novelty are (expected and) highly appreciated and will be rewarded accordingly. You should also have an appropriate literature review. Besides, projects will be evaluated by the professor and teaching assistants at the same level. In addition to them, contacts with mentors/assistants are possible through email communications. However, in some cases, skype sessions may be arranged. 

**Poster or Progress Report**: We strongly recommend students to prepare a poster (concerning the progress) of their projects. However, a brief report can also be submitted. Furthermore, students should also present them in a meeting on Wednesday, Dey 3 at 16:00 within the [Skype Group](https://join.skype.com/kJ6WepEDrsnt). This meeting is expected to provide an opportunity for students to be familiar with each other's progress on projects as well as sharing ideas. Consequently, students are asked to manage the meeting themselves and the course staff may not attend (However, the meeting will be recorded!). Those who don't prepare a poster should prepare several slides as well!    

    Poster/Progress Presentation will be on Thursday, Dey 11 at 16:00! 

**The Proposal, Poster/Progress, and Final Report's Format and Submission**: The writing and structure of the three documents are important and will be evaluated. The proposal should be at least three paragraphs; The poster should be in a conventional academic form or  a progress report of at least two pages can be submitted; The final report should also be at least four pages. They should be in the academic/publication format. In addition, documents must be in PDF format, which is written either (preferably) with LaTeX in English. You can use available templates; We recommend you to use [NeurIPS Style](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). You should upload documents (each document in a folder) as well as codes and data into a repository named exactly "Deep_Learning_F20_Project" (you can rename it once the course ended!). Please enter the title of your project as well as the link to its repository in the following link: [Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMK93A3ikwGmQKNKvCK1CXL2c3hgMQ2cr-DzDUU5u14/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Seminar Presentations**: Bahman 12 within the [Skype Group](https://join.skype.com/kJ6WepEDrsnt). Please prepare 5 to 10 slides for the presentation. Each student will have 10 minutes to talk and 5 minutes to answer questions. Professor, course staff, and possibly other researchers will attend. Therefore, practice to perfectly present your project. Presentations are also considered in the score of the project. The program of the seminar will be announced prior to the event.
    
    Deep Learning Projects' Seminar will be on Sunday, Bahman 19!
    
**Please consult with your mentor for more information!**

<-> The final project was announced at Shahrivar 26! Please follow the schedule!

MS Office or any other software could also be used, otherwise, images of your handwriting should be included, which is not recommended! Please acknowledge which one is used.

# Scores

* Scores will be announced at the end of the course. 
* Each assignment set is scored from 100 points as well as extra rewards. Therefore, it can be more than 100.
* **Submission after the deadline will not be accepted!** 
* Failure to comply with the [Academic Honor Code](https://github.com/hhaji/Deep-Learning#academic-honor-code) will result in the ZERO score in each set and may have additional consequences!
* The score of the final project will be calculated from 100 points. It may also be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* The final score of assignments will be calculated based on the weighted average of them, from 100 points. Moreover, it may be more than 100 due to the added rewards! 
* Scores may be commented. Furthermore, students could also comment on their scores and request for re-evaluation in the form of email, which will be considered at the end of the course.
